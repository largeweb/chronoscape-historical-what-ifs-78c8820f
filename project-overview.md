# Project Overview

Project Name: Chronoscape - Historical What-Ifs

Description: Chronoscape is an interactive platform where users explore alternative historical timelines through collaborative storytelling. Users can browse existing timelines, contribute to narratives, and "vote" on key decisions that shape the course of history. Premium members can propose new "what if" scenarios, gaining greater influence over the evolving narratives. All backend features are mocked.

Features:

*   Interactive Timeline: A visually engaging timeline display, showcasing key events and branching points in each "what if" scenario.
*   Collaborative Storytelling: Users can contribute to the narratives by writing new scenes, adding character details, and suggesting plot twists.
*   Image Integration: Ability to upload and embed images to enhance the storytelling and visualize the alternative historical settings.
*   "Decision Points": At specific points in the timeline, users can vote on potential outcomes, influencing the direction of the story.
*   Premium Scenario Proposals: Premium members can propose new "what if" scenarios, subject to community review.
*   Mock User Accounts and Premium Subscriptions: Frontend UI showing user profiles and mocked premium features.

Initial "What If" Scenario:

*   "What if the Library of Alexandria never burned down?" This scenario explores how the preservation of ancient knowledge could have drastically altered the course of scientific and technological development.

Technology Stack:
*   Cloudflare next-on-pages framework (NextJS) for the web application.
